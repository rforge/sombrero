SOMbrero 0.5
New features:
  Added an option for affectation type ("standard"/hard or "heskes"/soft
affectation)
  Updated shiny interface accordingly

Fixed bugs:
  Fixed a bug related to dist.type in selectNei. This bug did not affect the
learning in previous versions but could provide false values for protoDist
after the training.

********************************************************************************
SOMbrero 0.4-2
New features:
  Added PCA initialization
  Added Gaussian neighborhood (default parameters are still tentative)
  Added cosinus normalization for dissimilarity
  Added ANOVA like analyses for relational SOM interpretation
  Included a function to project an 'igraph' object on the grid

Fixed bugs:
  Fixed a bug in the computation of projected graph. Only edges with non zero
counts for the number of links are now listed in the edge list.

Misc:
  Added tests: to check the equivalence between automatic and manual scaling and
the equivalence between predicted clustering and the output of predict
  Updated vignettes

********************************************************************************
SOMbrero 0.4-1
New features:
  Added a parameter that tunes the gradient descent step
  Added a web user interface, implemented with shiny
  Added the topographic error to somRes.summary
  Improved the summary of somSC (table of neuron numbers and superclass numbers)

Code improvements:
  Changed default value of init.proto to "obs" for "relational" algorithm

Fixed bugs:
  Changed scree plot title and ylabel to "proportion of unexplained variables"

Misc:
  Added test: equivalence of numeric SOM and relational SOM on squared 
euclidian distance

********************************************************************************
SOMbrero 0.4
New features:
  Implementation of the "dissimilarity" algorithm to handle dissimilarity data
  Plots, quality functions and super-clustering have been updated to handle this
case

Code improvements:
  New way to handle distance calculations
  New way to handle the 'korresp' preprocessing (full matrix is now included)
  Slightly changed default values for Letremy's radius and neighborhood: they
are now exactly the same than in the original programs

Fixed bugs:
  Fixed bug with default options in korresp case
  Fixed bug with affectation step in korresp case
  Fixed bug for what="add" and type="graph" (node sizes were wrong)

Misc:
  Added markdown vignettes: one general and one for each case; hence, the
package now depends on R version 3.0 or higher
  Added citation file
  Added demos
  Removed unecessary tests and examples


********************************************************************************
SOMbrero 0.3
New features:
  Implementation of the "korresp" algorithm to handle contingency table
  Plots, quality functions and super-clustering have been updated to handle this
case

Fixed bugs:
  Bug fixed in the dendrogram of super-clustering (percentage of explained
variance was incorrectly displayed)
  Bug fixed in smooth.dist and umatrix (distances were reversed)


********************************************************************************
SOMbrero 0.2-2
New options:
  The argument 'the.titles' has been introduced in plot.somRes

New features:
  Implementation of a quality function for somRes object
  Implementation of a super-clustering for the resulting prototypes
  Implementation of a plot method for the results of the super-clustering


********************************************************************************
SOMbrero 0.2
Name changes :
  The argument 'scale' of 'somRes' object is now called 'scaling' (conflict with
  a R base function)

Argument changes :
  The argument 'dist.type' has been transfered from 'somRes' to 'myGrid' objects.

New options:
  Distance type on the grid   :   maximum, euclidean, manhattan, canberra, 
                                  binary or minkowski
New plots:
  Observations                :   color, lines, barplot, radar, boxplot and 
                                  names
  Prototypes                  :   lines, barplot, radar, 3d, poly.dist, umatrix 
                                  and smooth.disy
  Additional variable         :   pie, color, lines, barplot, radar, boxplot, 
                                  words, names and graph
