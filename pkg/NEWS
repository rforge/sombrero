SOMbrero 0.3
New features:
  Implementation of the "korresp" algorithm to handle contingency table
  Plots, quality functions and super-clustering has been updated to handle this
case

Fixed bugs:
  Bug fixed in the dendrogram of super-clustering (percentage of explained
variance was incorrectly displayed)
  Bug fixed in smooth.dist and umatrix (distances were reversed)


SOMbrero 0.2-2

New options:
  The argument 'the.titles' has been introduced in plot.somRes

New features:
  Implementation of a quality function for somRes object

  Implementation of a super-clustering for the resulting prototypes
  
  Implementation of a plot method for the results of the super-clustering


SOMbrero 0.2

Name changes :
  The argument 'scale' of 'somRes' object is now called 'scaling' (conflict with
  a R base function)

Argument changes :
  The argument 'dist.type' has been transfered from 'somRes' to 'myGrid' objects.

New options:
  Distance type on the grid   :   maximum, euclidean, manhattan, canberra, 
                                  binary or minkowski
New plots:
  Observations                :   color, lines, barplot, radar, boxplot and 
                                  names
  Prototypes                  :   lines, barplot, radar, 3d, poly.dist, umatrix 
                                  and smooth.disy
  Additional variable         :   pie, color, lines, barplot, radar, boxplot, 
                                  words, names and graph
